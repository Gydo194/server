# TCP server
## TCP socket server with callbacks written in C++

This was a side project once, you know the kind, one of the thousands of unfinished side projects.
Don't expect any useful functionality besides serving as an example for socket programming.

It only responds to a plaintext command 'test <args>' sent to TCP port 9034. The supplied args are printed to the console.

Be warned if you decide to use this, this code has not been tested for performance issues, security holes etc.
